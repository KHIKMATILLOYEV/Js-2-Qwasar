## Syntax of computer languages
### Introduction
Syntax is the basis for creating computer programs. This is similar to learning the alphabet and grammar before writing an essay. Coding is a language that we need to understand and master in order to create programs.

## What is a computer language?
Computer languages are ways of interacting with a computer. They are used to write computer code or program code, which is a set of instructions executed by a computer.

## Basic concepts
In this guide, we will look at several basic concepts of computer languages:

### Variables: 
Variables are used to store and process data. They may contain numbers, strings, or other data types, and their values may change during program execution.

### Cycles: 
Loops allow us to perform certain actions several times. They allow you to automate repetitive tasks and process data in arrays or lists.

### if-else statements: 
If-else statements are used to make decisions in the program. They check the condition and execute a certain block of code if the condition is true, or another block of code if the condition is false.
